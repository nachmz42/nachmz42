# Hello, I'm Nacho! 👋❄️🏔️

I'm a software enthusiast from Spain, currently residing on the sunny southern coast, although I prefer the cold mountains to the warm beach. I have a passion for sports and a thirst for learning new things whenever I can. My professional and academic journey may seem like a mix of unrelated paths, but that's because I always strive to step out of my comfort zone and take on new challenges to refine my skills. I have a knack for breaking down colossal tasks into manageable chunks, believing that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. This approach is what drives me in tackling every problem, and I think it's the essence of programming.

My initial encounter with programming was in web development, and I fell in love with the backend and databases. This led me to explore the world of data science and engineering, where I've decided to focus my efforts. To achieve this, I've taken on various challenges to expand my knowledge in this field.

## 👨‍🎓 Education

- BECA EOI: Introduction to programming with Java and Spring Boot for web development.
- Le Wagon Data Science Bootcamp Batch #1275: Gained fundamental skills in Python, which I apply to data science, machine learning, and data visualization.

## 💼 Professional Experience

- Fullstack Developer at Bahía Software (April 2023 - Present): I work in the R&D team, where we apply cutting-edge technologies to projects related to public health. I use React for the frontend and Java with Spring Boot for microservices on the backend. Lately, I've been working with the data science team, applying all the skills acquired in my training

- Backend Developer at NTTDATA (November 2021 - March 2023): I contributed to a project for a government ministry, focusing on data management technologies, including SQL, Java with Spring Boot, and Angular for frontend development (even though it wasn't my specialization).

## 📚 Academic Background

- Master's in Industrial Biotechnology (Pablo de Olavide) - Nov. 2019 - Jun. 2021
- Bachelor's in Biotechnology (U.M.H.) - 2015 - 2019

## 🚀 Projects

Here are some of my notable projects:

1. **MediML**
   - Description: Developed prediction tool for my final project in the Le Wagon bootcamp. It uses data from cardiovascular diseases and strokes to make predictions for different patients. Tha Back-End is developed in python while the Front-End is made with React.
   - [Back-End project](https://github.com/nachmz42/MediML) - [Front-End project](https://github.com/Remi-deronzier/mediml-front)

2. **What's that fruit?** (Work in progress)
   - Description: Little personal project where I try to apply the skills adquired during the Le Wagon bootcamp by myself.
